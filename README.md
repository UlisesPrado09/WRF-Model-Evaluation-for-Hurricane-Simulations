# WRF-Model-Evaluation-for-Hurricane-Simulations
Simulations for Hurricane Ianos (2020) were performed using the WRF model. Data from in situ observations and ERA5 Reanalysis data were used. Four model data outputs were extracted for plotting and analysis by calculating error metrics using python libraries.
